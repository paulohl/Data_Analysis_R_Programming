Question 1

Activity overview

Earlier, you learned about data frames. In this activity, you will create and use data frames in R.

As a refresher, a data frame is a collection of columns containing data, similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table. Data frames are one of the basic tools you will use to work with data in R. And you can create data frames from different data sources.

By the time you complete this activity, you will be able to create data frames with the data.frame() function and use  data frames to complete tasks in R. This will enable you to summarize and organize data in R, which will help give your R analyses more structure as you complete more advanced data analysis tasks.

Working in RStudio Cloud

To start, log into your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
this link
. Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: Course 7 -> Week 3 -> Lesson2_Dataframe.Rmd.

If you have trouble finding the correct activity, check out this 
step-by-step guide
 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file here:

You can also find the Rmd file with the solutions for this activity here:

Carefully read the instructions in the comments of the Rmd file and complete each step. Some steps may be as simple as running pre-written code, while others may require you to write your own functions. After you finish the steps in the Rmd file, return here to confirm that your work is complete.

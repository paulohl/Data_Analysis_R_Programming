### Activity overview
__________________
By now, you have learned many ways to change and work with data in a variety of settings, including spreadsheets and RStudio. In this activity, you’ll follow through a real-world 
scenario and practice manipulating and changing real data in R.

Upon completing this activity, you will know how to use functions to manipulate your data and use statistical summaries to explore your data. This will enable you to use R for more 
complex tasks in your career as a data analyst and help you gain initial insights into data that you can share with your stakeholders.

### Working in RStudio Cloud
____________________
To start, log into your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
[this link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2138069). 
Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: **Course 7 -> Week 3 -> Lesson3_Change.Rmd**.

The .csv file that you will need, hotel_bookings.csv, is also located in this folder.

If you have trouble finding the correct activity, check out this 
[step-by-step guide](https://cursive.io/shared/28dc296d9-5515-41a9-9bf6-84369bd247e3)
 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file and the data for this activity directly here:

### Activity overview
_____________________
Earlier in this course, you encountered Practice ggplot2, an R package for data visualization. In this activity, you’ll learn about the basic logic	 
of data visualization in ggplot2 and how to Practice 	create a plot using R code. 

By the time you complete this activity, you’ll be able to write R functions that create data visualizations. This will enable you to create basic 
visualizations to demonstrate and share Video: findings with your data and code. 

### The basics of ggplot2
________________________
The ggplot2 package lets you make high quality, customizable plots of your data. As a	refresher, ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, which is a 
system for describing and building data visualizations. The essential idea behind the grammar of graphics is that you can build any plot from the same 
basic components, like building blocks.

These building blocks include:
* A dataset
* A set of geoms: A geom refers to the geometric object used to represent your data For example you can use points to

### Activity overview
______________________

So far, you have used ggplot2 to create different kinds of visualizations. In this activity, you’ll follow through a scenario and add annotations to a data 
visualization with ggplot2. You will also learn how to save images from ggplot2 visualizations.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to enhance a visualization with annotations and save it as an image so that you can add it directly to a 
presentation. This will enable you to demonstrate your findings more clearly and better explain your insights in your career as a data analyst.

### Working in RStudio Cloud
____________________________

To start, log in to your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
[this link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2138069)
. Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: **Course 7 -> Week 4 -> Lesson4_Annotations.Rmd**.

The .csv file that you will need, hotel_bookings.csv, is also located in this folder.

If you’re having trouble finding the correct activity, check out this 
[step-by-step guide](https://cursive.io/shared/28dc296d9-5515-41a9-9bf6-84369bd247e3)
 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file and the data for this activity directly here:

You can also find the Rmd file with the solutions for this activity here:

Carefully read the instructions in the comments of the Rmd file and complete each step. Some steps may be as simple as running pre-written code, while others 
may require you to write your own functions. After you finish the steps in the Rmd file, return here to confirm that your work is complete.

### Confirmation
________________

The first time you saved an image in Step 5, what dimensions did you put in the ggsave() function? 


( ) 5x5


( ) 7x7

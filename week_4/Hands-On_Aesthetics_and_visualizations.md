![alt text](https://github.com/paulohl/Data_Analysis_R_Programming/blob/main/img/lightbulb-HandsOn.png)

### Activity overview
_____________________
In previous activities, you learned about and worked with ggplot2, an R package for data visualization. In this activity, youâ€™ll follow through a scenario and continue to apply ggplot2 to tailor aesthetic features of visualizations.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to use R to create bar charts, update chart labels, and customize the aesthetics of a visualization by specific criteria. This will enable you to make more complex visualizations to demonstrate your findings.

### Working in RStudio Cloud
____________________________
To start, log in to your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
[this link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2138069)
. Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: **Course 7 -> Week 4 -> Lesson3_Aesthetics.Rmd**.

The .csv file that you will need, hotel_bookings.csv, is also located in this folder.

If you have trouble finding the correct activity, check out this 
[step-by-step guide](https://cursive.io/shared/28dc296d9-5515-41a9-9bf6-84369bd247e3)
 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file and the data for this activity directly here:

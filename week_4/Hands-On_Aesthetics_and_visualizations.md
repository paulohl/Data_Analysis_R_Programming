### Activity overview
_____________________
In previous activities, you learned about and worked with ggplot2, an R package for data visualization. In this activity, youâ€™ll follow through a scenario and continue to apply ggplot2 to tailor aesthetic features of visualizations.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to use R to create bar charts, update chart labels, and customize the aesthetics of a visualization by specific criteria. This will enable you to make more complex visualizations to demonstrate your findings.

### Working in RStudio Cloud
____________________________
To start, log in to your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with

 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file and the data for this activity directly here:

You can also find the Rmd file with the solutions for this activity here:

Carefully read the instructions in the comments of the Rmd file and complete each step. Some steps may be as simple as running pre-written code, while others may require you to write your own functions. After you finish the steps in the Rmd file, return here to confirm that your work is complete.

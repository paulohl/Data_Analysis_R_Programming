### Activity overview
_____________________
So far, you have learned a lot about ggplot2 and how to create data visualizations in R. In this activity, you’ll follow through a scenario and use the filters and facets features of ggplot2.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to customize your visualizations by applying filters and highlighting facets. This will enable you to emphasize certain aspects of your insights to create comparisons and more nuanced insights in your presentations.

### Working in RStudio Cloud
____________________________
To start, log in to your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
[this link](https://rstudio.cloud/project/2138069)
. Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: **Course 7 -> Week 4 -> Lesson3_Filters.Rmd**.

The .csv file that you will need, hotel_bookings.csv, is also located in this folder.

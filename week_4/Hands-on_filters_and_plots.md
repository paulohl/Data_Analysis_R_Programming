# Hands-On Activity: Filters and plots


Activity overview

So far, you have learned a lot about ggplot2 and how to create data visualizations in R. In this activity, youâ€™ll follow through a scenario and use the filters and facets features of ggplot2.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to customize your visualizations by applying filters and highlighting facets. This will enable you to emphasize certain aspects of your insights to create comparisons and more nuanced insights in your presentations.

Working in RStudio Cloud

To start, log in to your RStudio Cloud account and open the project with 
this link
. Navigate to the file explorer in the bottom right and click on the following: Course 7 -> Week 4 -> Lesson3_Filters.Rmd.

The .csv file that you will need, hotel_bookings.csv, is also located in this folder.

If you have trouble finding the correct activity, check out this 
step-by-step guide
 on how to navigate in RStudio Cloud. Make sure to select the correct R markdown (Rmd) file. The other Rmd files will be used in different activities.

If you are using RStudio Desktop, you can download the Rmd file and the data for this activity directly here:

You can also find the Rmd file with the solutions for this activity here:

Carefully read the instructions in the comments of the Rmd file and complete each step. Some steps may be as simple as running pre-written code, while others may require you to write your own functions. After you finish the steps in the Rmd file, return here to confirm that your work is complete.

Confirmation

In Step 5 of this activity, you created a data frame onlineta_city_hotels_v2. What is the lead time in the first row created in this data frame?

Correct
The lead time in the first row of the onlineta_city_hotels_v2 data frame is 88. By using a filter with ggplot2, you are able to select specific segments of your data and plot them using R. Going forward, you can use filters and facets to compare visualizations of different aspects of the same data to gain even deeper insights from your analyses.
